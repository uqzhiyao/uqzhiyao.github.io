**Partner**: South Australia Water

<br/>**Project Description**: This project aims to reduce the direct greenhouse gas (GHG) and odour emissions from sewage sludge during sludge handling processes (e.g., sludge drying), via a novel acidic aerobic digestion (AAeD) process. Through integrated laboratory studies and pilot-scale demonstration, this project will offer wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) with an innovative retrofitting solution that can be integrated with existing sludge treatment systems (Fig. 1). This new option will expand engineering options available to water utilities for achieving net-zero, providing guidance for retrofitting current facilities and informing future design.
