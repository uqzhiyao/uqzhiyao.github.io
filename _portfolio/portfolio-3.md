Melbourne Water is using lagoons for sludge drying at the Eastern Treatment Plant. A dataset of methane emissions from the lagoon has been collected over a 12+ month operational cycle, possibly with more data to be collected in the future. Melbourne Water is seeking support from The University of Queensland in the development of a mathematical model to gain more insights into the in-lagoon physical, chemical and biological processes from the collected data. The model may also be used to support future lagoon operations.

The objectives of this project include:

1) Develop a static model to describe the overall mass balance in the SDP and to validate the emission factor recommended by IPCC;
2) Develop a dynamic model to describe the temporal variations of methane emissions;
3) Elucidate the dependence of methane emission on the operational conditions and identify potential mitigation opportunities.
