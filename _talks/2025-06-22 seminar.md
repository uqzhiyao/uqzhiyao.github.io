ICoN9 – The Ninth In­ter­na­tional Con­fer­ence on Ni­tri­fic­a­tion and Re­lated Pro­cesses

My talk was selected as the Best Presentation at the ECR Workshop of the ICoN9 Conference—earning me the opportunity to present it twice!

This was my first ICoN, but definitely not the last. Hopefully the first of many to come. I am pleased to meet many familiar names from the literature—turning “citations” into real conversations. Truly inspiring to meet and learn from so many excellent researchers in the field.

A heartfelt thanks to the Theo Murphy Initiative (Australia) and @ Australian Academy of Science for supporting my participation.

And sincere thanks to the ICoN9 organizing committee for putting together such a memorable conference.
